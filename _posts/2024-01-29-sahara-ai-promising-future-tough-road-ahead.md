## Let's Talk About Sahara.AI

Sahara.AI is building a decentralized AI platform powered by blockchain, aiming to create an open, transparent, secure, and inclusive AI ecosystem. Their vision is to enable various participants—data scientists, developers, investors, and resource providers—to collaborate in the creation of innovative AI products known as "AI Assets." The ambition is bold and exciting...

This mission is meaningful in today's world, achieving it won't be easy.

AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has become an integral part of our daily lives. AI agents in various forms—chatbots, multimodal content generators, and beyond—are everywhere. Behind this, there is a race dominated by a few tech giants and their AI-backed enterprises, all competing to develop more powerful models and better AI products that users love.

We find ourselves in an endless AI arms race, where innovation never stops, and the push for more advanced AI capabilities intensifies.

## Challenges on the Road to Decentralized AI

Will enough people embrace the decentralization of AI and actively support Sahara.AI in achieving AI breakthroughs or developing cutting-edge AI products in the long run?

One major challenge is computational power, the key factor in building impactful AI assets. Training an LLM model on the scale of ChatGPT is both time-consuming and extremely expensive—requiring vast computational resources, including thousands of NVIDIA H100 GPUs.

Tech giants dominate this space because they have products that directly benefit from their AI advancements, making it worthwhile for them to invest in compute power. But what about decentralization advocates and independent compute providers? What motivates them to contribute their expensive resources? Will they stay committed, or will they eventually abandon Sahara.AI when incentives no longer align?

## A Clash with Open-Source AI?

Another question arises: Will AI agents in Sahara.AI conflict with open-source AI agent frameworks?

There are already many powerful, open-source LLM models and AI frameworks that allow unrestricted innovation. These projects do not enforce ownership—they enable developers to build freely on top of existing models.

If Sahara.AI aims to create an open AI ecosystem, can a decentralized AI platform truly coexist with and enhance the existing open-source movement? Or will it introduce new barriers rather than breaking them down?
