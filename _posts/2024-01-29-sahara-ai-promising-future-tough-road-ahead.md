Let's Talk About Sahara.AI. Sahara.AI is building a decentralized AI platform powered by blockchain, aiming to create an open, transparent, secure, and inclusive AI ecosystem. In this ecosystem, various participants—data scientists, AI developers, investors, and resource providers—can collaborate to create innovative AI products known as "AI Assets" (datasets, models, AI agents, etc.).

#### **Introduction to Sahara.AI**

While this mission is meaningful in today's world, achieving it won't be easy. AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has become deeply involved in our daily lives. AI agents in various forms—chatbots, multimodal content generators, and more—are now ubiquitous. Behind this, there is a fast race, mainly participated by a few tech giants and AI enterprises (e.g., Microsoft and OpenAI). They compete to build more powerful models and better AI products that users love.

We are now in an endless AI race, where the push for more advanced AI tools continues to accelerate.

#### **Challenges on the Road to Decentralized AI**

##### **Long-term Support**

For Sahara.AI to succeed, it needs consistent contributions from various participants to maintain stability and sustainability. Achieving AI breakthroughs and producing cutting-edge AI products on Sahara is possible only in the long run, and they are necessary to Sahara.ai's growth and its own narrative.

One major challenge is computational power, the key factor in building impactful AI assets. Training an LLM model on the scale of ChatGPT is both time-consuming and extremely expensive—requiring vast computational resources, including thousands of NVIDIA H100 GPUs.

Tech giants have these resource investments because their core products depend on their own AI advancements. But what about independent compute providers who have the hardware but lack such incentive? Will they be willing to endure the time and opportunity costs to support a decentralized AI network like Sahara.AI? Or will they eventually lose interest and leave the platform?

<br />

##### **Open Source Compatibility**

Another question is whether Sahara.AI will complement or compete with open-source AI communities. The number of open-source AI assets is growing rapidly, including open-source LLM models (e.g., DeepSeek), datasets, and AI agent frameworks (e.g., Swarms). These projects do not enforce ownership, allowing developers to build freely and contribute to a broader AI ecosystem.

However, it remains unclear whether these open-source assets will integrate with Sahara.AI's platform or if the two will compete instead of coexist. Can a decentralized AI platform truly enhance the open-source movement?


To be continued...
